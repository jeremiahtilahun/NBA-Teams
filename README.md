## Welcome to Valorant
Valorant is a new free-to-play multiplayer first person shooter that has similar movement and shooting mechanics to CSGO while incorporating an ability and ultimate system similar to Overwatch. It was released as a beta on April 7 and the full version was released on June 2. The current game modes are: Unrated for a slow paced, unranked setting, Competitive, which requires more skill and synergy with your team, Spike Rush, for short, unskilled games, and Deathmatch, to improve your aim. The current competitive ranks are Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Immortal, and Radiant.

There are currently 12 characters, each with their own special abilities that you can purchase to utilize during the rounds. Each character has an ultimate that is activated when enough kills/orbs are collected. The character that I main is Breach. If I have enough money, I can buy 3 flashes and 1 aftershock, and 1 fault line is automatically given to me.
